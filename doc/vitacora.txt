24/01/2013 -> I modified the project in order to be deployed in jboss as 7 with hibernate
    - I noticed there are some differences between hibernate and eclipselink
        It don't compile well in hibernate: PersonEJB.java
            TypedQuery<Person> query = em.createNamedQuery("findAllPersons", Person.class);
